My name is Seth Decker and this is a blog on learning how to apply tensorflow and convolutional neural networks to real world problems. I'm a master's student at UNM and enjoy learning and solving all sorts of problems, ranging from Computer Vision problems like the ones I go over to other things and stuff. I need a better idea on what all I should have here.
