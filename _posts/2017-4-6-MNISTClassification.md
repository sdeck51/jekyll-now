title: Tensorflow - MNIST Classification
---
Here we'll get familiar with tensorflow by building a CNN for classifying MNIST.

# Data
We're using the MNIST dataset, which is an assortment of grayscale images representing hand written digits 0 through 9. 

First thing we need to do is get the data. Fortunately this is already available in the Tensorflow library

code: input_data stuff

Lets also display an image from it.

Now that we're confident that we understand the data we can build a network. We're going to build a simple 2 convolution layer CNN.
